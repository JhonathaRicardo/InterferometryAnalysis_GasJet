## Abstract
The interferometric technique is an important tool for analysis and diagnosis in astronomy, spectroscopy, metrology, plasma physics, particle physics, and other areas. In Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) studies, knowing the density distribution of the target gas is crucial to understand the phenomena involved in the particle acceleration process [[1]](#reference).
This Python algorithm was developed to recover the accumulated phase across the neutral gas target as well as estimate the target density distribution.

Interferometry Analysis - Gas-Jet software was developed in Python 3.11 and the use of this algorithm requires the installation of some packages: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) [[2]](#reference), [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) [[3]](#reference) and [PyAbel](https://pyabel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) [[4]](#reference) for data processing, [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) [[5]](#reference) to manipulate interferogram images, [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) [[6]](#reference) to plot results, and
[PySimpleGui](https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/) to create the users template.

The second way to use this software is through the executable file. The users can create a single .exe file using the [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) package trought the follow terminal command:

<code>   pyinstaller --onefile -w IntAnalysis_GasJetProfile.py                </code>

## How to use it
Interferometry Analysis - The Gas-Jet software has a graphical interface developed with PysimpleGUI. This interface assists users and facilitates their applications.
In this section, we provide users with a simple review of the software's functions and how to use them.

- ***[Exit]*** Close software.

### Options
- ***[Select Analysis Area]*** From the parameters in this form, the user can select the interferogram area to apply the algorithm to determine the gas-jet density profile. The selected area is defined by a rectangle with edges defined by X and Y coordinates (***[Y Coord]*** and ***[X Coord]***).
The user that intends to use the whole interferogram figure needs to uncheck the checkbox ***[Use select area]***.

- ***[Experimental Parameteres]*** In this form, the user set the experimental parameters used to obtain the interferogram image. These parameters are:
  - ***[Laser Wavelength]*** and ***[uncertainty Laser Wavelength]*** in nm;
  - Gas ***[Polarizability]*** in angstromÂ³. This parameter usually refers to the tendency of matter to acquire an electric dipole moment when subjected to an electric field.
   - The ***[Specific Heat Ratio]*** of a gas is the ratio of the specific heat at constant pressure, ***Cp***, to the specific heat at constant volume, ***Cv***.

## How it work
The interferogram analysis software algorithm works according to the flowchart below:

### Accumulated Phase
The Accumulated Phase map or accumulated phase shift map is obtained from the shifts of the speckle fields from two interferogram images. The first is the interferogram image with fringes disturbed due to the presence of gas and the second is a background image with undisturbed fringes. According to the flowchart, apply 2D Fourier transforms on both interferograms by transporting them in the frequency domain. Applying a Gaussian filter over the region containing the phase shift information [[7]](#reference) and inverting the Fourier transform over two frequency domain maps. Finally, we obtain the accumulated (or integrated) phase-shift map $&Delta;&phi;_{z}$ [[7, 8]](#reference) along the beam propagation direction (z direction) by the following equation:

$$ 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\phi_{z} =  tan^{-1}\left({\phi_{gas} - \phi_{background}}\right)
\tag{1}
\end{equation}
$$

where  $\phi_{gas}$  and  $\phi_{background}$   is the background phase map.

#### Standard Deviation of Accumulated Phase

According to M. Lehmann [[9]](#reference), for two well-resolved speckle fields (background and perturbed by gas) the phase error is determined by the probability distributions of the intensities and phase derivatives of two speckle fields. Considering that each field has a Gaussian distribution of speckle intensities and since the measured phase is the difference between two speckle phases, its error also follows a Gaussian probability distribution, with standard deviation given by:

$$ 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\Delta\phi}(\Delta x, I_{1} ,I_{2}) = {\Delta x \over 2}{\pi \over \beta} \left\lbrack{ \overline{I} (I_{1} + I_{2}) \over 2 I_{1} I_{2}}\right\rbrack^{1/2}
\tag{2}
\end{equation}
$$

where $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are the intensity distribution of both speckle fields (with mean intensity $\overline{I}$ each), $&Delta;x$ is the displacement of the image in the direction perpendicular to the direction axis of the fringes, and $\beta$ is the speckle size. 

### Inverse Abel Transform

As mentioned above, $\Delta\phi_{z}$ the integrated phase map along the laser beam propagation direction (z direction).
Assuming an axisymmetric gas-jet, the integrated information along z is sufficient to reconstruct the radial information using inversion $\Delta\phi_{r}$ such as the Abel inversion method [[8]](#reference).

$$ \Delta\phi_{r} = - {1 \over \pi} \int_{r}^{\infty} {d (\Delta\phi_{z}) \over dz} {dz \over \sqrt {zÂ² - rÂ²}} \tag{3}$$ 

In this software, the phase map is determined from the application of the PyAbel [[4]](#refence) algorithm on the accumulated phase map.
PyAbel is a Python package that provides functions for the forward and inverse Abel transforms. The inverse Abel transform takes a 2D projection and reconstructs a slice of the cylindrically symmetric 3D distribution, which makes this function an important tool in analyzing the projections of angle-resolved, plasma plumes, flames, solar occultation [[4]](#reference), and gas-jets.

PyAbel provides efficient implementations of several Abel transform algorithms [[10]](#reference). No software Interferogram Analysis o mÃ©todo de transformaÃ§Ã£o escolhido foi o algoritmo de deconvoluÃ§Ã£o Dash Onion Peeling por ser simples e computacionalmente muito eficiente. De acordo com Dash [[11]](#reference), esse mÃ©todo tem menos suavizaÃ§Ã£o do que outros mÃ©todos.  

#### Standard Deviation of Inverse Abel Transform
The accuracy of applying the inverse Abel transform is associated with the standard deviation generated by a convolution between the phase map and the integrated phase map.

### Density Profile
The gas molecular density $\rho_{gas}$ is obtained through the simple expression of the Lorentz-Lorenz relation [[12, 13]](#reference):

$$ \rho_{gas} = {3 \over 4\pi\alpha} {(n^2-1) \over (n^3+2)} \tag{4}$$

where $\alpha$ is the molecular polarizability of gas and $n$ is the spatial refractive index distribution. This 2D refractive index map is determined from the phase-shift map $\Delta\phi_{r}$:

$$ n = 1 + {\Delta\phi_{r} \lambda \over 2\pi} \tag{4}$$



#### Standard Deviation of Density
The accuracy of the gas density measurement depends on the accuracies of the phase-shift measurement ($\sigma_{measurement} = \sigma_{\Delta\phi_{z}}$), and the numerical accuracy of the Abel inversion [[14]](#reference) ($\sigma_{abel}$). This way, the standard deviation of phase-shift map $\sigma_{\Delta\phi_{r}}$ can be write as ($5$):

$$  \sigma_{\Delta\phi_{r}} = \sqrt{\left({\sigma_{measurement}}^2 + {\sigma_{abel}}^2\right)} \tag{5}$$

So, the standard deviation of gas density $\sigma_{\rho}$ is given by ($6$):

$$ 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\rho} = \sqrt{\left({\partial\rho \over \partial\Delta\phi_{r}}\right)^2 \left({\sigma_{\Delta\phi_{r}}}\right)^2 + 
\left({\partial\rho \over \partial\lambda}\right)^2 \left({\sigma_{\lambda}}\right)^2}
\tag{6}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\sigma_{\lambda}$ is user-defined experimental parameter.
  > **Note**
  > The contribution of this parameter to the density standard deviation is usually very small.
