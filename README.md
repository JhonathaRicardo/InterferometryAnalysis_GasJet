## Abstract
<p align = "justify">
The interferometric technique is an important tool for analysis and diagnosis in astronomy, spectroscopy, metrology, plasma physics, particle physics, and other areas. In Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) studies, knowing the density distribution of the target gas is crucial to understand the phenomena involved in the particle acceleration process [[1]](#reference).
This Python algorithm was developed to recover the accumulated phase across the neutral gas target as well as estimate the target density distribution.

## Installation
Interferometry Analysis - Gas-Jet software was developed in Python 3.11 and the use of this algorithm requires the installation of some packages: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) and [PyAbel](https://pyabel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for data processing, [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) to manipulate interferogram images, [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) to plot results, and
[PySimpleGui](https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/) to create the users template.

The second way to use this software is through the executable file. The users can create a single .exe file using the [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) package trought the follow terminal command:

<code>   pyinstaller --onefile -w intAnalysis_GasJetProfile.py                </code>

## How to use
Interferometry Analysis - The Gas-Jet software has a graphical interface developed with PysimpleGUI. This interface assists users and facilitates their applications.
In this section, we provide users with a simple review of the software's functions and how to use them.
### Main Screen

<p align = "justify">
[Open File]: Open the interferogram image(s) file(s) with the presence of gas jet . Image file extensions should preferably be .png or .snp. However, all image extensions (.gif, .jpg, .bmp, etc) could be used.  
 
[Rotate]: Image rotate
